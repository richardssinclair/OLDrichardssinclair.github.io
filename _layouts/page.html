    <p>
      Growing up in a creative environment I developed skills in paint, sculpting, photography and film I became really passionate about the arts. A few months ago I was inspired by a creative coding meet up where I saw amazing animations, games and portfolios all done in Javascript. This inspired me to become a Developer. I was amazed by what people had done in the digital world where the limit is down to your imagination. I joined the Web Developer Immersive Course at General Assembly where I learnt new skills in web developing and am now looking for a new role where I can develop these skills further.

      This 12 week course taught me the basic fundamentals of programming. Some of the areas covered were HTML, CSS JavaScript, AngularJs, JQuery, Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, AJAX, NodeJS, Express, and SASS. The course taught me to analyse problems and figure out ways to break them down. It was a truly unique and inspiring experience.
