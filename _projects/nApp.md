Having many stand ups where colleagues would talk about their dreams, in a team we created an online  
dream diary. We implemented a ‘mood board’ where a user can play calming sounds that will help them   
sleep. This was a great learning phase for me. I managed to pair with my team and learn how to tackle  
problems differently.
